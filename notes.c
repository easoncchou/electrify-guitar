/*
notes based on experiments today (OCT 29 2024)
- microphone works, just needs the adapter it came with
- dividing int sample (the reading) by 1000 made it unhearable
- dividing int sample by 100 made it unhearable
- diving int sample by 10 made it a lot quieter
- it seems using the overdrive effect causes the subsequent use 
  of the tremolo and/or the delay take longer e.g. half a second 
  delay becomes like 2 or smth
